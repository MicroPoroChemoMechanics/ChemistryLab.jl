    struct ChemicalSystem{T<:AbstractSpecies, R<:AbstractReaction, C, S, SS} <: AbstractVector{T}

An immutable, fully typed collection of chemical species and reactions
with derived index structures and stoichiometric matrices.

Immutability guarantees that all derived fields (`dict_species`, `dict_reactions`,
index vectors, `CSM`, `SM`) remain consistent with `species` and `reactions`
throughout the lifetime of the object. To modify the system, use `merge` to
construct a new `ChemicalSystem`.

# Fields

  - `species`: ordered list of all species.
  - `dict_species`: fast O(1) lookup by species symbol.
  - `idx_aqueous`, `idx_crystal`, `idx_gas`: indices by aggregate state.
  - `idx_solutes`, `idx_solvent`, `idx_components`, `idx_gasfluid`: indices by class.
  - `reactions`: ordered list of all reactions.
  - `dict_reactions`: fast O(1) lookup by reaction symbol.
  - `CSM`: canonical stoichiometric matrix.
  - `SM`: stoichiometric matrix with respect to primaries.
  - `solid_solutions`: `Nothing` when no solid solutions are present, or a concrete
    `Vector{<:AbstractSolidSolutionPhase}` describing each solid-solution phase and
    its end-members. Populated via the `solid_solutions` keyword constructor.
  - `ss_groups`: for each solid solution, the indices of its end-members in `species`.
  - `idx_ssendmembers`: union of all end-member indices (flattened `ss_groups`).
  - `idx_kinetic`: indices of kinetic species (empty when none declared).

    _expand_instances(species, solid_solutions) -> (species, solid_solutions)

Give every declaration asking for `instances > 1` the extra species it needs.

A `SolidSolutionPhase` with `instances = k` becomes `k` phases: the declaration
itself, then `k-1` copies named `"\$name#2"`, `"\$name#3"`, … whose end-members
are copies of the originals under `"\$symbol#2"`, `"\$symbol#3"`, … Each copy
shares the whole property dictionary of the species it was made from, so the two
are one substance under two labels and carry byte-identical thermodynamic data.

Why the copies are needed at all: the composition vector has one entry per
species, so a species belongs to exactly one phase. Two coexisting compositions
of one substance — which is what the Gibbs minimum is inside a spinodal — cannot
be written down without the substance appearing twice.

Why it is done by duplicating the species rather than by letting two phases share
them: it keeps `ss_groups` **disjoint**, so the activity assembly, the mole
fraction fill and the optimality certificate need no change at all. Sharing an
index would make the last group written win.

The duplicated column leaves the row rank of the conservation matrix unchanged —
it is a copy of a column already there — so conservation is untouched, and the
copies start at zero amount, so a budget computed as `A n` is unchanged too.

Returns the inputs unchanged, and without copying, when no declaration asks for
more than one instance. That is every system the shipped data describes.

    _refuse_overlapping_solid_solutions(solid_solutions)

Refuse a system in which two declared solid solutions describe the same
substance, naming the pair.

The case this exists for is the calcium silicate hydrate. CEMDATA18 carries
three descriptions of it — `CSHQ`, `CNASH_ss` and the `ECSH` family — and they
are three *models of one gel*, not three phases. Declaring two of them counts
the same hydrate twice: the calcium, the silicon and the alkalis all enter the
element balance once and come out distributed over two phases that are supposed
to be alternatives.

The overlap is exact rather than approximate, which is what makes it detectable
here: `KSiOH` (an end-member of `CSHQ`), `ECSH1-KSH` and `ECSH2-KSH` all carry
the formula `((KOH)2.5SiO2H2O)0.2`. Two end-members of two different declared
phases with the same composition are therefore the signature, and the check is
composition-based rather than name-based so that it does not depend on the
database's naming.

Two end-members of the SAME phase may of course share nothing — that is a
mixture — and a pure phase repeating a mixing phase's composition is a separate
question the rank test upstream already refuses.

**Instances of one declaration are exempt**, and that exemption is the whole
reason `SolidSolutionPhase` carries a `declared` field. A miscibility gap is
represented by the same binary present twice, on purpose, as two coexisting
compositions — which is composition overlap of exactly the kind this function
refuses. Telling the deliberate case from the mistake cannot be done by
composition, since they look identical; it is done by provenance, and two phases
share a `declared` name only when `ChemicalSystem` itself made the second from
the first.

    ChemicalSystem(species, primaries=species; kinetic_species, solid_solutions) -> ChemicalSystem

Construct a fully typed `ChemicalSystem` from a vector of species,
an optional vector of primary species, optional kinetic species with rates,
and optional solid-solution phases.

All derived fields are computed once at construction time and remain
consistent for the lifetime of the object.

# Arguments

  - `species`: vector of `AbstractSpecies`.
  - `primaries`: subset used as independent components (default: all species).
  - `kinetic_species`: `nothing` (default) or a dictionary / vector of pairs mapping
    each kinetic species (by name `String` or `Species` object) to its rate function.
    Rate functions must be callable as `(T, P, t, n, lna, n_initial) → Real [mol/s]`
    (see [`KineticFunc`](@ref)). The rate is given per mole of kinetic species
    (stoichiometric coefficient = 1); the constructor corrects by `1/|νₖ|` automatically.
    When provided, the nullspace N of the stoichiometric matrix is diagonalized so that
    each kinetic species appears in exactly one reaction. Those reactions are stored in
    the `reactions` field with their rate attached via `rxn[:rate]`.
  - `solid_solutions`: vector of [`SolidSolutionPhase`](@ref) (default: `nothing`).
    When provided, end-members must already appear in `species` (matched by symbol) and
    must carry `aggregate_state = AS_CRYSTAL` and `class = SC_SSENDMEMBER`.

"""
    Base.merge(cs1::ChemicalSystem, cs2::ChemicalSystem) -> ChemicalSystem

Construct a new `ChemicalSystem` from the union of two systems.

Species and reactions are unioned by symbol — duplicates from `cs2` are discarded.
`CSM` and `SM` are built from scratch from the full species list.
Primaries are taken as the union of both systems' primaries, filtered
to those actually present in the merged species list.

In case of symbol conflict (species or reactions), `cs1` takes priority over `cs2`.
The return type is inferred from the merged collections and may differ from
`typeof(cs1)` or `typeof(cs2)` if they contain different concrete types.

```jldoctest
julia> cs1 = ChemicalSystem(
           [Species("H2O"; aggregate_state=AS_AQUEOUS, class=SC_AQSOLVENT),
