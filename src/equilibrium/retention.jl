# Water retention: the relation between how much water is left in the pore

# This is the constitutive input the capillary coupling needs, and it is not

# size distribution — it is a property of the particular material, and it evolves

    abstract type WaterRetention

A relation between the degree of saturation of the pore space and the activity
of the water left in it.

The interface is one method: a subtype is **callable**, `r(S) -> a_w`, mapping a
degree of saturation `S ∈ [0, 1]` to a water activity in `(0, 1]`. `S = 1` is a
saturated pore space, where the water is held by nothing and `a_w = 1`.

Two ways to obtain one:

  - a **measured desorption isotherm**, through [`TabulatedRetention`](@ref);
  - a **fitted form** — [`VanGenuchten`](@ref) — whose parameters the caller
    supplies.

And one way to build your own: a pore size distribution plus
[`kelvin_activity`](@ref).

!!! warning "No defaults, deliberately"
    Every named law takes its parameters as keyword arguments **without default
    values**, so omitting one raises `UndefKeywordError` on the spot. A retention
    curve is a measurement on a specific material at a specific age; a default
    would be a number invented on the user's behalf and then silently believed.

"""
    kelvin_activity(r; γ, V_m, T) -> Real

Activity of water held in a pore of radius `r` by its own meniscus,
`a_w = exp(-2 γ V_m / (r R T))`.

This is the whole of the physics the capillary coupling adds. Water in a fine
pore is at a lower chemical potential than bulk water of the same composition,
so hydrates that consume water become less stable, and below some pore size the
reaction stops — which is what self-desiccation is.

Every parameter is a keyword **without a default**: the surface tension `γ`
belongs to the liquid and the temperature, and the molar volume `V_m` to the
liquid, so neither is the package's to assume.

    TabulatedRetention(; S, a_w) -> TabulatedRetention

A measured desorption isotherm, as two vectors: degrees of saturation and the
water activities (relative humidities) at which they were observed.

Interpolation is linear in `ln a_w` against `S`, which is the variable the
capillary coupling actually uses and the one in which a Kelvin curve is closest
to straight. Both keywords are mandatory.

`S` must be strictly increasing and `a_w` non-decreasing with it — a retention
curve that falls as the pore space fills is not a retention curve, and an inner
constructor refuses it rather than interpolating nonsense. Outside the tabulated
range the value is clamped to the nearest end and a warning is issued once: an
isotherm measured between `S = 0.3` and `S = 1` says nothing about `S = 0.05`,
and extrapolating a logarithm there produces confident absurdity.

# Examples

```julia
# RH measured at four saturations on a hardened paste

converted to a water activity by the Kelvin relation
`a_w = exp(-p_c V_m / (R T))`, with `V_m` and `T` supplied by the constraint
that uses it.

Both parameters are mandatory keywords: `a` is a capillary pressure scale (Pa,

There are no defaults — the pair belongs to a fitted material, not to the
package.

[BaroghelBouny1999](@cite) fit exactly this expression to measured water-vapor
desorption isotherms, and write it with `b = 1/m`:

```

so a `b` from that literature becomes `m = 1/b` here. Their Table 5, read from

    water_activity(r::WaterRetention, S; V_m, T) -> Real

Activity of the water a retention law leaves at degree of saturation `S`.

For a law that is already stated as an activity — [`TabulatedRetention`](@ref), or
a measured isotherm wrapped in [`FunctionRetention`](@ref) — this is the law
itself and `V_m` and `T` are ignored. For a law stated as a **capillary
pressure**, [`VanGenuchten`](@ref), it is the Kelvin relation
`a_w = exp(-p_c V_m / RT)`, which is why the molar volume and the temperature
have to be supplied: a pressure curve carries no temperature, and turning it into
an activity does.

Both are keywords without defaults, for the reason given in

    FunctionRetention(f)

A bare function as a retention law: `f(S)` is the **water activity** at degree of
saturation `S`.

This is the escape hatch for a curve that is neither a measured table nor van
Genuchten — a closed form from a pore-size distribution, an isotherm fitted with
someone else's expression, or a constant, which is how the tutorial's negative
control imposes one humidity and watches nothing happen.

Because the value returned *is* an activity, [`water_activity`](@ref) ignores its
`V_m` and `T`: there is no Kelvin conversion to make. A law stated as a capillary
pressure belongs in [`VanGenuchten`](@ref) instead, and passing a pressure here
would be read as an activity of several million.

!!! warning "Nothing validates `f`"
    [`TabulatedRetention`](@ref) checks its table and [`VanGenuchten`](@ref)
    checks its parameters, both in inner constructors. `f` is opaque, so it is
    trusted: it should return a value in `(0, 1]`, and it should not increase as
    the pore space dries. [`CapillaryWater`](@ref) does test it at `S = 1` and
    refuses a law that is already out of range there, which catches a sign error
    or a percentage but not a curve that misbehaves in the middle.

[`CapillaryWater`](@ref) and [`PoreHumidity`](@ref) wrap a bare function in this
type themselves, so `CapillaryWater(S -> ...; reference = fresh)` needs no
explicit construction.
