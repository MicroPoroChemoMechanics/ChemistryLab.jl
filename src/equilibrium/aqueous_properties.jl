# ── Aqueous properties of a solved state ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# The activity closures compute the molalities, the ionic strength and the
# activity coefficients on their way to the log-activities, and used to keep all
# three to themselves. Anyone comparing a state against GEM-Selektor, PHREEQC or
# Reaktoro needs them species by species, so they are read back here.
#
# Two things this file is careful about, because both have produced wrong
# comparisons:
#
#   * γ is computed from the model's formula, not as a ratio a/m. A species
#     parked at the solver's lower bound has its log-activity dominated by the
#     closures' `+ ϵ` regularization, and the ratio then returns nonsense —
#     values of order 1e300 for a charge class whose only members are trace.
#     The formula is a function of the ionic strength and the charge alone and
#     is exact whatever the amount.
#   * An activity is a number on a scale, and nothing in the number says which.
#     `DiluteSolutionModel` puts its solutes on the molarity scale and takes
#     ρ = 1 kg/L, so its activities happen to equal the molalities as numbers;
#     the other two are on the molality scale, where that equality holds by
#     construction. [`concentration_scale`](@ref) is the only way to tell them
#     apart, and it stops being a formality as soon as ρ departs from 1 kg/L.

    solvent_fraction(state) -> Float64

Mole fraction of the aqueous solvent within the aqueous phase,
`n_w / Σ_aqueous n`. One for pure water, and the number that says whether there
is still a solution to speak of.

Every quantity built on the aqueous phase — molality, ionic strength, activity,
pH — is defined *per kilogram of solvent*, and the dual solver parameterizes its
interior variables by the solvent's chemical potential. All of that presumes the
solvent is the phase, not one species in it. A real electrolyte, even a
concentrated one, keeps `x_w` above about 0.9: seawater is 0.99, a saturated NaCl
brine 0.90.

Below [`SOLVENT_FRACTION_FLOOR`](@ref) the formulation has no ground left.
Measured on a sealed cement paste driven under its stoichiometric water demand —
w/c = 0.28 on the mix of the [w/c example](@ref sec-wc-ratio) — the Gibbs
minimum consumes the free water down to 6e-9 mol, `x_w` falls to 0.21, and the
ionic strength comes out at 409 mol/kg against a Debye-Huckel model valid to
about one. The amounts such a solve reports are not equilibrium values; the
answer is that the question was posed outside the model's domain.

    molalities(state::ChemicalState; ϵ = 1e-16) -> OrderedDict{String,Float64}

Molality `mᵢ = nᵢ / (n_w Mw)` of every aqueous solute, in mol per kg of solvent.

The solvent itself is not a solute and is omitted. `ϵ` floors the amounts the
same way the activity closures do, so the values match what the solver saw;
species at the floor come back at a molality of order `ϵ` rather than zero.

"""
    ionic_strength(state::ChemicalState; kind = :effective, ϵ = 1e-16) -> Float64

Molality-basis ionic strength `I = ½ Σⱼ mⱼ zⱼ²`, in mol/kg.

`kind` selects which of the two ionic strengths is meant, and they are different
quantities:

  - `:effective` (the default) sums over the **speciated free ions** — the
    composition as solved, with every complex and ion pair counted at its own
    charge. A neutral pair such as `Ca(SO4)@` contributes nothing. This is the
    one every activity model in this package is a function of, and the one to
    pass to any of them.
  - `:stoichiometric` sums as if every complex were **fully dissociated** into
    the components of `state.system`, so `Ca(SO4)@` contributes as
    `Ca²⁺ + SO₄²⁻`. This is the analytical ionic strength of the recipe rather
    than of the solution, and it is what some correlations for salting-out and
    for diffusivity are fitted against.

The gap between them measures how much of the salt is associated. On a Portland
cement pore solution it is small — 0.2121 against 0.2136 mol/kg, 0.7 % — because
little is paired at that ionic strength; on a sulfate brine it is not.

Neither is a property of the activity model: both are properties of the
composition. Compare the effective one before comparing anything else — an
ionic strength that disagrees between two codes means they are not describing
the same solution, whatever their volumes happen to agree on.

The stoichiometric sum uses the decomposition of each species over the system's
primaries (`state.system.SM.A`), counting `|νₚ| zₚ²` for each charged primary
`p`. That is the same decomposition the mass balance uses, so it needs no
separate table of dissociation reactions; note that it attributes `OH⁻`, which
CEMDATA18 writes as `H₂O − H⁺`, one unit of charge through the `H⁺` component,
which is the right count.

Throws if the system has no aqueous phase, or on an unknown `kind`.

                   ϵ = 1e-16, kelvin_shift = 0.0)
        -> OrderedDict{String,Float64}

Natural log of the activity of **every** species, in the model's own convention.

This is the vector the Gibbs energy is built from: `μᵢ/RT = ΔₐG⁰ᵢ/RT + ln aᵢ`.
Crystals of a pure phase get `ln a = 0`, solid-solution end-members `ln a = ln xᵢ`
plus their excess term, the solvent its osmotic contribution, and solutes the
log of their concentration in the model's scale plus `ln γᵢ`.

A species at the solver's lower bound has its value dominated by the closures'
`+ ϵ` regularization; read [`activity_coefficients`](@ref) rather than dividing
these by a concentration.

# Examples

```julia
lna = log_activities(eq, model)
lna["H2O@"]                                  # ln a_w
exp(lna["Portlandite"])                      # 1.0 for a pure phase that is present
```

# The capillary shift

`kelvin_shift` is added to the solvent's log-activity, and it is `0.0` by
default so that nothing changes for a caller who does not ask.

It exists because an activity model computes the activity of water from the
**composition** of the solution and knows nothing about the pore that holds it.
Under [`CapillaryWater`](@ref) the solve is posed with a shifted solvent
potential — the Kelvin term — and that shift is returned to the caller in the
`parameters` reference, not stored in the state. Reading the activities back
without it therefore reports the chemical value and not the pore value: after a
solve posed at `a_w = 0.90` this function returns 0.999995 unless the shift is
passed in.

The two lowerings are independent and their chemical potentials add, so the
activities multiply:

```math
a_w = a_w^{\\mathrm{chem}} \\cdot a_w^{\\mathrm{cap}}
    = \\exp\\!\\left(-M_w\\varphi\\sum_i m_i\\right)
      \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{2\\gamma V_m}{rRT}\\right)
```

with `kelvin_shift` the logarithm of the second factor — a **negative** number,
since a meniscus lowers the activity. [`water_activity`](@ref) is the accessor
for the composed value.

# Examples

```julia
q = Ref{Vector{Float64}}()
eq, cert = equilibrate_certified(state; constraint = CapillaryWater(law; reference = fresh),
                                 parameters = q)
lna = log_activities(eq, model; kelvin_shift = q[][1])   # the pore water

    water_activity(state::ChemicalState, model::AbstractActivityModel;

The activity of water in `state`, composed of both lowerings.

      \\cdot
      \\underbrace{\\exp(\\texttt{kelvin\\_shift})}_{\\text{the pore}}
```

The first factor is what the activity model computes from the composition. The
second is the capillary term, which is **not** a property of the composition: it
depends on the pore the water sits in, so it has to be supplied. Pass the shift
that [`CapillaryWater`](@ref) returned through its `parameters` reference, or
compute one from a retention law with
[`water_activity`](@ref)`(r, S; V_m, T)` and take its logarithm.

Left at its default the function reports the chemical water activity alone,
which is the right answer for a solution in a container and the wrong one for a
solution in a gel pore.

Activity coefficient γᵢ of every aqueous species, from the model's formula.

Solutes are evaluated as `γᵢ = 10^(log₁₀ γᵢ)` with the model's own expression —
`−A zᵢ² √I/(1 + B åᵢ √I) + Ḃ I` for the ions of [`HKFActivityModel`](@ref), `Kₙ I`
for its neutrals, and identically 1 for [`DiluteSolutionModel`](@ref), which is
ideal *on its own* (molarity) scale. The solvent is reported as `γ_w = a_w / x_w`.

**Not** computed as a ratio of activity to concentration. That ratio agrees for
an abundant solute — and the tests check that it does — but it diverges for a
species parked at the solver's lower bound, whose log-activity is dominated by
the closures' `+ ϵ` term: it returns values of order 1e300 for a charge class
whose only members are trace. The formula depends on the ionic strength and the
charge alone, so it is exact for a trace species and for a major one alike.

The electron, `e⁻`, carrying the conventional standard state
``\\Delta_f G^0 = \\Delta_f H^0 = S^0 = C_p^0 = V^0 = 0``.

This is a **convention**, exactly as it is for `H⁺`, and not a measurement: no
thermodynamic database tabulates a free electron in solution. Fixing its
standard state at zero is what makes a half-reaction's ``\\log K`` well defined,
and every redox potential computed from it inherits that convention. The choice
is the usual one in geochemistry, so the numbers here are comparable with
published half-reaction constants.

    pe(state, model; couple = "SO4-2" => "HS-") -> Float64

The electron activity of the pore solution as ``pe = -\\log_{10} a_{e^-}``,
read off one redox couple.

There is no electron species to read an activity from, so `pe` is **inferred
from a half-reaction**: the couple's two members are balanced over `H⁺`, `H₂O`
and the electron, the reaction's ``\\log K`` is computed from the standard
Gibbs energies the database carries, and the electron activity is what remains.
For a half-reaction with `n` electrons on the oxidized side,

```math
pe = \\frac{1}{n}\\left(\\log_{10} K
     - \\sum_{\\text{products}} \\nu_i \\log_{10} a_i
     + \\sum_{\\text{reactants} \\neq e^-} \\nu_i \\log_{10} a_i \\right)
```

`couple` names the oxidized and the reduced member, in that order. The default
is sulfate/sulfide, which is the couple a slag-blended cement buffers.

!!! warning "Different couples need not agree, and the disagreement is a result"
    A single `pe` exists only if every couple is at **mutual** equilibrium. In a
    real paste they are not: sulfate reduction is slow enough to be frozen on
    the time scale of hydration, so the sulfur couple and the iron couple can
    report potentials hundreds of millivolts apart. Computing `pe` from two
    couples and comparing them measures how far the assumption of a single redox
    state is from holding — which is worth doing before trusting either.

# to zero, so the objective's gradient is unbounded on exactly the face where a
# mixing phase vanishes.
#
# GEM-Selektor solves this by computing an initial approximation rather than

# "LPP-based automatic initial approximation of the primal vector x" obtained
# with a "modified simplex method with two-side constraints". Reproducing that
# needs a genuine LP solver — a barrier method on a linear objective is not one,
# and measured here it does not move off the cold state at all.
#
# What does work, and needs no new algorithm, is continuation. Scale everything
# but the solvent by λ and walk λ from a small value to 1, each step started

    saturation_indices(state, model; ϵ = 1e-16) -> OrderedDict{String, <:Real}

`LogSI` for every species at `state`: `log₁₀(IAP/K)` of the reaction that forms it
from the system's primaries.

Zero for a phase at equilibrium with the solution, negative for one that is
undersaturated, positive for one that **should have precipitated**. It is the
quantity GEM-Selektor prints as `LogSI`, and the one an
[`optimality_certificate`](@ref) summarizes into a single worst violation without
saying which phase that is.

No fitting is involved. The row labels of the conservation matrix are the primary
species, so a component's element potential is that primary's chemical potential,
`y_c = μ_c/RT`, and

```
LogSI_s = [Σ_c A_cs y_c − μ_s/RT] / ln 10
```

which is [`saturation_ratio`](@ref) written for the formation reaction
`s = Σ_c A_cs (primary c)`. A conservation row that labels no species — the
charge row — contributes nothing, since the coefficient of any neutral phase
there is zero.

Two things to know before reading the numbers:

  - **The check is built in.** Every phase actually present at an equilibrium
    must come out at `LogSI = 0`; measured on a CEM I paste, the twelve present
    solids land within 1.2e-12. If they do not, the state is not an equilibrium
    and no other index in the result means anything.
  - **A solid-solution end-member's index is relative to its current mole
    fraction**, since its activity is `ln x`. For an end-member at the solver's
    lower bound that is a statement about a vanishing phase, not about whether
    the solid solution would form.

si = saturation_indices(eq, model)

        -> Union{ChemicalState, Nothing}

An automatic initial approximation obtained by continuation in the amount of
solute.

Scales every species except the aqueous solvent by a factor `λ`, and walks `λ`
through `steps` up to 1, solving at each value from the answer to the previous
one. At `λ = 1` the composition is exactly `state`, so the returned composition
respects the same element balance; it is a **starting point**, not a certified
equilibrium.

`steps` is a suggestion, not a schedule. A rung is **accepted only if it
conserves mass**, and a refused rung is retaken by halving the distance back to
the last `λ` that worked, up to `max_bisections` times per target. Both halves of
that matter: a rung that has wandered off the balance would otherwise be carried
forward as the start of every later rung, and a rung that simply cannot be taken
in one jump can be taken in two.

The acceptance test is `|rᵢ| ≤ balance_atol + balance_rtol · scaleᵢ` on the
element-balance residual, row by row, with
`scaleᵢ = max(|bᵢ|, Σⱼ |Aᵢⱼ| nⱼ)`. It has to be mixed rather than relative: two
conservation rows carry a legitimately negligible budget — electroneutrality is
exactly zero, and a cement recipe is routinely given a carbon trace of 1e-9 mol
— so a relative test rejects residuals of 1e-10 mol as if they were failures.
Neither tolerance certifies anything; `balance_atol` sits above the accuracy the
interior point itself reaches (~3e-6 mol here) because a rung is a guess, and
the certificate judges the result afterwards.

This is what makes a realistic cement solvable from a cold start: with all the
mass in the reactants and every product at the `ϵ` floor, no back end reaches
the optimum, because an interior-point method started against the boundary of a
system spanning sixteen orders of magnitude in amount cannot take a useful step.
At small `λ` the same system is dilute and well away from that boundary.

It requires **nothing** from the caller beyond the initial state: no guess at
which phases will form, no knowledge of the answer. [`equilibrate_certified`](@ref)
calls it automatically when its ordinary starting points fail to certify, so
ordinary use never needs it.

The walk is done under `model`, which defaults to [`DiluteSolutionModel`](@ref)
and should normally be left there **even when the target is a non-ideal model**.
Measured on the CEM I paste: walking under the extended Debye-Hückel model with
a common ion size of zero runs away to an ionic strength of 18 mol/kg, because
that model's coefficients fall steeply with `I`, which raises solubility, which
raises `I`. The ideal model has no such feedback, walks cleanly, and its answer
is a good starting point for the non-ideal one — which is how
[`equilibrate_certified`](@ref) uses it.

Returns `nothing` if the walk produced nothing usable.

Differentiability is unaffected. Under `ForwardDiff`, `equilibrate_certified`
strips to the primal state, solves in `Float64` and attaches the sensitivity
through the implicit function theorem, so this never sees a `Dual` and the
derivative does not depend on how the starting point was found.

        -> Union{ChemicalState, Nothing}

Solve one rung of the continuation, and **accept it only if it conserves mass**.

`nothing` means "refuse this rung", which the walk answers by taking a smaller
step. Two things can go wrong at a rung, and only one of them raises: a back end
can throw, or it can return an answer that is not on the constraint surface. The
second is the dangerous one, because the walk would then carry that composition
forward as the start of every later rung. Measured on a CEM I paste: an accepted
rung off the balance by moles takes the whole walk with it, and
`equilibrate_certified` ends on an answer with an element balance of 6.7 mol —
every hydrate at zero, and a table of amounts that reads like a result.

The test is the mixed one, `|rᵢ| ≤ atol + rtol · scaleᵢ`, and it has to be mixed.
A purely relative test is meaningless on this problem because two conservation
rows carry a legitimately negligible budget: electroneutrality is **exactly
zero**, and a cement recipe is routinely given a carbon trace of 1e-9 mol.
Measured at λ = 0.01 on that paste, a residual of 1.7e-10 mol on the charge row
scores 168 against its own budget and a residual of 1.1e-10 mol on the carbon
row scores 10.6 — both physically nothing, both rejected, and the walk then
never reached its first three targets while still appearing to work. A row
holding 1e-11 mol cannot be balanced better than the solver's absolute floor,
and asking it to be is a category error.

`scaleᵢ = max(|bλᵢ|, Σⱼ |Aᵢⱼ| nⱼ)`: the row's own budget, or the amount of that
component actually being moved around when the budget is near zero — the natural
yardstick for a conservation row that nets to nothing. `atol` sits above the
accuracy the interior point itself reaches (about 3e-6 mol on this class of
problem), because a rung is a guess and not an answer. Neither number certifies
anything: they are there to reject a rung that has *wandered*, and the
certificate judges the result afterwards.
