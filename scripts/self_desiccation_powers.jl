# Where does Powers' 0.42 come from?
#
# Powers' rule of thumb caps the degree of hydration of a sealed paste at
# `α_max = (w/c) / 0.42`. This script takes that coefficient apart into a water
# budget, supplies each term from an independent source — the chemistry from a
# Gibbs energy minimization, the arrest saturation from a published desorption
# isotherm — and reports what the two together imply.
#
# Nothing here is fitted to 0.42.
#
# Usage:
#   julia --project=scripts scripts/self_desiccation_powers.jl
#   or from the REPL:  include("scripts/self_desiccation_powers.jl")
#
# Companion to the tutorial "Self-desiccation and Powers' 0.42".
