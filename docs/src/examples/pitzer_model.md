# [The Pitzer model, and what it can be used with](@id sec-app-pitzer)

[Activity models](@ref sec-theory-activity) §6 derives the ion-interaction
model and says why its Gibbs-Duhem consistency is exact rather than
approximate. This page loads the shipped parameter set, checks that claim, and
establishes what the set may and may not be combined with — which turns out to
be the practical question.

```@example pz
using ChemistryLab
using DynamicQuantities
using ForwardDiff
using LinearAlgebra
using Printf

pars = build_pitzer_parameters(datapath("pitzer-reardon1990.toml"))
model = PitzerActivityModel(; parameters = pars)

substances = build_species(datapath("slop98-inorganic-thermofun.json"); verbose = false)
dict = Dict(symbol(s) => s for s in substances)
nacl = ChemicalSystem([dict[s] for s in split("H2O@ Na+ Cl-")], ["H2O@", "Na+", "Cl-"])
# the molar mass the closures themselves use, so a molality formed here is the
# one they form
M_w = ustrip(us"kg/mol", nacl.species[only(nacl.idx_solvent)][:M])
n_w = 1 / M_w
prm(k) = (ΔₐG⁰overRT = zeros(k), T = 298.15, P = 1.0e5, ϵ = 1.0e-30)

```

## 1. The set says which of its numbers were measured

Reardon's tables are those of Harvie, Møller and Weare, except that the
silicate, aluminate and ferrate parameters had no published data at all and were
**estimated by analogy** — he names the analog in each case. Those are exactly
the ions a cement assemblage needs, so the set carries the distinction and
[`pitzer_origin`](@ref) reads it back:

```@example pz
for (c, a) in (("Na+", "Cl-"), ("Ca+2", "SO4-2"), ("Ca+2", "OH-"),
               ("Ca+2", "Al(OH)4-"), ("Na+", "H3SiO4-"), ("Na+", "H2SiO4-2"))
    @printf("  %-5s / %-9s  β⁰ = %+8.4f   β¹ = %+8.4f   β² = %+8.2f   %s\n",
            c, a, pars.beta0[(c, a)], pars.beta1[(c, a)], pars.beta2[(c, a)],
            pitzer_origin(pars, c, a))
end
```

A `β²` appears only where the pair needs a third ionic-strength dependence —
2-2 electrolytes, and Ca–OH, which Harvie et al. treat the same way.

## 2. Against measurement, over four decades of molality

Internal consistency cannot tell a correct parameter set from a self-consistent
wrong one. [HamerWu1972](@cite) can: their Table 16 is a critical compilation of
the osmotic and mean activity coefficients of NaCl at 25 °C, and it gives both,
so each half of the model is checked separately.

```@example pz
# Hamer & Wu (1972), Table 16. m [mol/kg], φ, γ±.
HW = [(0.001, 0.988, 0.965), (0.010, 0.968, 0.903), (0.100, 0.933, 0.779),
      (0.500, 0.921, 0.681), (1.000, 0.936, 0.657), (2.000, 0.984, 0.668),
      (3.000, 1.045, 0.714), (4.000, 1.116, 0.783), (5.000, 1.191, 0.874),
      (6.000, 1.270, 0.986)]

lna_pz = activity_model(nacl, model)
lna_bd = activity_model(nacl, HKFActivityModel())
γ_of(f, m) = let o = f([n_w, m, m], prm(3)); exp((o[2] + o[3]) / 2 - log(m)) end
φ_of(f, m) = let o = f([n_w, m, m], prm(3)); -o[1] / (M_w * 2m) end

println("      m   γ± measured   Pitzer      dev     B-dot       dev    φ meas   φ Pitzer")
for (m, φm, γm) in HW
    g1, g2, f1 = γ_of(lna_pz, m), γ_of(lna_bd, m), φ_of(lna_pz, m)
    @printf("%7.3f  %11.4f  %8.4f  %6.2f%%  %8.4f  %6.1f%%  %8.4f  %9.4f\n",
            m, γm, g1, 100 * (g1 - γm) / γm, g2, 100 * (g2 - γm) / γm, φm, f1)
end
```

The Pitzer column follows the measurement to better than half a percent from a
millimolal to six molal — through the **minimum near 1 mol/kg and the climb back
to 0.99 at six molal**, neither of which any Debye-Hückel form can produce, since
both require a term that grows faster than ``\sqrt{I}`` and then turns over. The osmotic coefficient agrees to the same order, independently.

The B-dot column is not being criticized for failing outside its stated range.
The point is that the range is real — 5 % out at a tenth molal, 19 % at one,
44 % at six — and that nothing in its output announces the exit.

```@example pz
using Plots

ms = exp10.(range(-3, log10(6.0); length = 120))
p1 = plot(ms, [γ_of(lna_pz, m) for m in ms];
    xscale = :log10, xlabel = "molality m (mol/kg)", ylabel = "γ±",
    label = "Pitzer (Reardon set)", linewidth = 2, color = :steelblue,
    title = "NaCl mean activity coefficient at 25 °C", legend = :bottomleft)
plot!(p1, ms, [γ_of(lna_bd, m) for m in ms];
    label = "B-dot", linewidth = 2, color = :firebrick)
A25 = hkf_debye_huckel_params(298.15, 1.0e5).A
plot!(p1, ms, [exp(-A25 * sqrt(m) * log(10)) for m in ms];
    label = "Debye-Hückel limiting law", linestyle = :dot, color = :gray, linewidth = 2)
scatter!(p1, [h[1] for h in HW], [h[3] for h in HW];
    label = "Hamer & Wu (1972), measured", color = :black, markersize = 5)
plot(p1; size = (720, 430), left_margin = 8Plots.mm, bottom_margin = 8Plots.mm)
```

Read on a logarithmic axis, the three models are one curve below a millimolal —
they must be, the limiting law is exact there — and separate irreversibly above
a hundredth molal. The measured points sit on the Pitzer curve throughout.

```@example pz
p2 = plot(ms, [100 * (γ_of(lna_pz, m) - 1) * 0 for m in ms];
    label = "", color = :black, linewidth = 1, linestyle = :dash,
    xscale = :log10, xlabel = "molality m (mol/kg)",
    ylabel = "deviation from measurement (%)",
    title = "Where each model leaves the data", legend = :bottomleft)
scatter!(p2, [h[1] for h in HW], [100 * (γ_of(lna_pz, h[1]) - h[3]) / h[3] for h in HW];
    label = "Pitzer", color = :steelblue, markersize = 5)
scatter!(p2, [h[1] for h in HW], [100 * (γ_of(lna_bd, h[1]) - h[3]) / h[3] for h in HW];
    label = "B-dot", color = :firebrick, markersize = 5, markershape = :diamond)
hline!(p2, [-1, 1]; label = "± 1 %", color = :seagreen, linestyle = :dot)
plot(p2; size = (720, 430), left_margin = 10Plots.mm, bottom_margin = 8Plots.mm)
```

This is also, incidentally, a check on the **transcription** of the parameter
file: the Na/Cl coefficients were read off a scanned table, and nothing mistyped
reproduces a measured curve over four decades.

## 3. The dilute limit, exactly

A model that expands around ideality has no freedom as the solution empties:
`log₁₀ γ± → −A|z₊z₋|√I`, and this is the check a mistyped coefficient cannot
survive either.

```@example pz
println("       m        ln γ± (Pitzer)    limiting law     ratio")
for m in (1.0e-6, 1.0e-5, 1.0e-4, 1.0e-3)
    out = lna_pz([n_w, m, m], prm(3))
    lnγ = ((out[2] - log(m)) + (out[3] - log(m))) / 2
    law = -A25 * sqrt(m) * log(10)
    @printf("  %8.1e    %14.6f  %14.6f  %8.4f\n", m, lnγ, law, lnγ / law)
end
```

## 4. Gibbs-Duhem, exactly

The reason to prefer this model. ``\gamma_i`` and ``\varphi`` are partial
derivatives of one excess Gibbs energy, so ``\sum_i n_i\,\mathrm{d}\mu_i = 0``
is an identity of the algebra. Taken with automatic differentiation — a finite
difference would measure its own truncation error, which at 0.1 mol/kg is
larger than the quantity being tested:

```@example pz
μ_pz = build_potentials(nacl, model)
μ_bd = build_potentials(nacl, HKFActivityModel())

function gd(mu, m, dn)
    n0 = [n_w, m, m]
    dμ = ForwardDiff.jacobian(nn -> mu(nn, prm(3)), n0) * dn
    return abs(sum(n0 .* dμ)) / max(norm(n0 .* abs.(dμ)), 1.0)
end

println("                          Pitzer        B-dot")
for (name, dn) in ("dissolution  " => [0.0, 1.0, 1.0],
                   "ion exchange " => [0.0, 1.0, -1.0],
                   "water removal" => [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0])
    for m in (0.1, 1.0, 3.0)
        @printf("  %s m = %4.1f   %10.3e   %10.3e\n",
                name, m, gd(μ_pz, m, dn), gd(μ_bd, m, dn))
    end
end
```

Zero, at machine precision, in every direction and at every molality — against
a B-dot residual that grows with concentration. No fit was involved in either
column; the difference is structural.

## 5. What the set refuses, and why that is correct

A Pitzer model cannot fall back on ideal behavior for one pair, so
completeness is checked when the model meets a species list, and the error names
what is missing:

```@example pz
with_br = ChemicalSystem(
    [dict[s] for s in split("H2O@ Na+ Cl- Br-")], ["H2O@", "Na+", "Cl-", "Br-"]
)
try
    activity_model(with_br, model)
catch err
    println(first(split(err.msg, ". ")), ".")
end
```

The same mechanism refuses something more important. **A Pitzer set assumes the
speciation it was fitted with**, and Reardon's is fully dissociated: the
association of Ca with SO₄, of Na with OH, is inside the ``\beta``
coefficients. A species list that also carries the ion pairs counts each
association twice — and CEMDATA18 carries them:

```@example pz
cem = build_species(datapath("cemdata18-thermofun.json"); verbose = false)
pairs_present = [
    symbol(s) for s in cem
        if symbol(s) in ("Ca(SO4)@", "CaOH+", "Na(SO4)-", "K(SO4)-", "NaOH@", "KOH@",
                         "Na(CO3)-", "MgSO4@", "HSiO3-", "SiO2@")
]
println("ion pairs and silica species CEMDATA18 carries: ", join(pairs_present, ", "))
```

So the shipped set is **not** a drop-in for a CEMDATA18 cement calculation, and
the refusal above is the right outcome rather than a shortcoming of the
implementation: a dissociated parameterization combined with an associated
speciation is not a defensible calculation in any code. Using this model on a
cement pore solution means building the species list the set describes — the
free ions and the solids — or obtaining a parameter set fitted for the
speciation at hand.

## 6. Where it does apply

A dissociated alkali-hydroxide-sulfate solution of the kind a cement pore
solution approximates, at an ionic strength where the B-dot model is already
out of its range:

```@example pz
pore = ChemicalSystem(
    [dict[s] for s in split("H2O@ Na+ K+ Ca+2 OH- SO4-2")],
    ["H2O@", "Na+", "K+", "Ca+2", "OH-", "SO4-2"],
)
lna_pz = activity_model(pore, PitzerActivityModel(; parameters = pars))
lna_bd = activity_model(pore, HKFActivityModel())

# a mixture in the proportions an alkali-rich pore solution reaches
n = [n_w, 0.30, 0.15, 0.02, 0.40, 0.045]
a_pz, a_bd = lna_pz(n, prm(6)), lna_bd(n, prm(6))
names = ["H2O@", "Na+", "K+", "Ca+2", "OH-", "SO4-2"]
println("            γ (Pitzer)   γ (B-dot)    ratio")
for (i, nm) in enumerate(names)
    i == 1 && continue
    m = n[i] / (n[1] * M_w)
    g_pz, g_bd = exp(a_pz[i] - log(m)), exp(a_bd[i] - log(m))
    @printf("  %-6s  %10.4f  %10.4f  %8.3f\n", nm, g_pz, g_bd, g_pz / g_bd)
end
@printf("\n  a_w:    %10.5f  %10.5f\n", exp(a_pz[1]), exp(a_bd[1]))
```

The two models disagree by tens of percent on the ions, and the disagreement is
not a refinement: at this ionic strength the B-dot term is doing work it was
never fitted for, while the Pitzer set was fitted over exactly this range. Which
is right is a question for measurement, not for a docstring — but only one of
the two is thermodynamically consistent with its own water activity, and §3 says
which.
