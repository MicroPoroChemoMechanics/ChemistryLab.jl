# [What the choice of activity model costs](@id sec-app-activity-models)

[Activity models](@ref sec-theory-activity) sets out what the three built-in
models are and where each comes from. This page puts numbers on the difference,
because the answer is not the one a reader would guess: the models disagree
mildly about the *value* of the water activity and enormously about its
*derivative*, and equilibrium is set by the derivative.

Everything below is evaluated on an imposed NaCl composition. Nothing is solved,
so the whole page costs a few milliseconds — which is also the point: comparing
models does not require a converged equilibrium.

```@example am

substances = build_species(datapath("slop98-inorganic-thermofun.json"); verbose = false)
dict = Dict(symbol(s) => s for s in substances)
cs = ChemicalSystem([dict[s] for s in split("H2O@ H+ OH- Na+ Cl-")],
                    ["H2O@", "H+", "Na+", "Cl-", "Zz"])
sym_w = symbol(cs.species[only(cs.idx_solvent)])

## 1. ``A`` and ``B`` are properties of water

The Debye-Hückel coefficients are not fitting constants: they follow from the
density and the dielectric constant of water, and
[`hkf_debye_huckel_params`](@ref) evaluates them from this package's own equation
of state. The defaults the models carry, ``A = 0.5114`` and ``B = 0.3288``, are
therefore *derived* — and they agree with [Helgeson1981](@cite) Table 1:

```@example am
for T in (298.15, 333.15, 373.15)
    p = hkf_debye_huckel_params(T, 1.0e5)
    w = water_thermo_props(T, 1.0e5)
    e = water_electro_props_jn(T, 1.0e5, w)
    ρ = w.D / 1000
    @printf("T = %6.2f K   ρ = %.4f g/cm³   ε = %6.2f   A = %.4f   B = %.4f\n",
            T, ρ, e.epsilon, p.A, p.B)
end
```

Both rise with temperature, because water's dielectric constant falls faster
than ``T`` rises: hot water screens worse, so the same ionic strength costs more.

## 2. The screening length, in nanometers

``\kappa^{-1} = 1/(B\sqrt{I})`` in ångström, when ``B`` is in Å⁻¹(kg/mol)^½:

```@example am
B25 = hkf_debye_huckel_params(298.15, 1.0e5).B
println("     I (mol/kg)    Debye length (nm)")
for I in (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0)
    @printf("   %10.3f    %14.3f\n", I, 1 / (B25 * sqrt(I)) / 10)
end
```

A cement pore solution sits near ``I \approx 0.1``–``0.5`` mol/kg, so its
screening length is **a few ångström** — two or three water molecules, and the
width of the gel pores where a hydrating paste keeps its last water. That
coincidence is discussed in
[the water budget](@ref sec-theory-water-budget); it is the reason to treat an
extended Debye-Hückel model as a correlation in bulk solution rather than a
theory of confined water.

## 3. The activity coefficients, and the water activity

```@example am
println("               γ(Na⁺)                        a_w")
println("  m      dilute   Davies    B-dot      dilute   Davies    B-dot")
for m in (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0)
    st = nacl(m)
    γ = [activity_coefficients(st, mod)["Na+"] for (_, mod) in models]
    aw = [exp(log_activities(st, mod)[sym_w]) for (_, mod) in models]
    @printf("%6.3f  %7.4f  %7.4f  %7.4f    %7.5f  %7.5f  %7.5f\n", m, γ..., aw...)
end
```

Read the ``\gamma`` columns first. The ideal model is already several percent off
at a **millimolal**, which is worth knowing before treating ideality as a safe
default. The two corrections do not agree with each other either — they part
company around a tenth molal — and by 3 mol/kg Davies has returned
``\gamma > 1`` while the B-dot model is still below 1: the ``bI`` term has taken
over, which is the ceiling of the B-dot construction arriving.

Now the ``a_w`` columns, and here the surprise: **they barely separate at all.**
The Raoult and osmotic routes differ by a few parts in a thousand even at
3 mol/kg. It would be easy to conclude that the water-activity route is a
detail.

Seen as curves rather than as a table, the separation is a matter of where each
model leaves the limiting law:

```@example am
using Plots

ms = exp10.(range(-3, log10(3.0); length = 120))
γ(mod, m) = activity_coefficients(nacl(m), mod)["Na+"]
aw(mod, m) = exp(log_activities(nacl(m), mod)[sym_w])
A25 = hkf_debye_huckel_params(298.15, 1.0e5).A

p1 = plot(; xscale = :log10, xlabel = "molality m (mol/kg)", ylabel = "γ(Na+)",
    title = "Three models, one electrolyte", legend = :bottomleft)
for ((name, mod), col) in zip(models, (:gray, :firebrick, :steelblue))
    plot!(p1, ms, [γ(mod, m) for m in ms]; label = name, linewidth = 2, color = col)
end
plot!(p1, ms, [exp(-A25 * sqrt(m) * log(10)) for m in ms];
    label = "Debye-Hückel limiting law", linestyle = :dot, color = :black, linewidth = 2)
plot(p1; size = (720, 430), left_margin = 8Plots.mm, bottom_margin = 8Plots.mm)
```

```@example am
p2 = plot(; xscale = :log10, xlabel = "molality m (mol/kg)", ylabel = "water activity a_w",
    title = "The water activity barely separates", legend = :bottomleft)
for ((name, mod), col) in zip(models, (:gray, :firebrick, :steelblue))
    plot!(p2, ms, [aw(mod, m) for m in ms]; label = name, linewidth = 2, color = col,
        linestyle = name == "Davies" ? :dash : :solid)
end
plot(p2; size = (720, 430), left_margin = 10Plots.mm, bottom_margin = 8Plots.mm)
```

The ideal and Davies curves lie on top of each other in the second figure —
both are Raoult — and the B-dot curve is a fraction of a percent away. A reader
stopping here would conclude that the water-activity route is a detail. The next
section is why that conclusion is wrong.

## 4. Gibbs-Duhem: the values agree, the derivatives do not

Equilibrium is set by chemical potentials, that is by derivatives of the
activities with respect to composition — not by their values. So the test that
matters is whether ``\sum_i n_i\,\mathrm{d}\mu_i = 0`` holds along a composition
change, and it is measured here along three directions, because each exposes a
different defect.

```@example am
M_W = 0.0180153
n_w = 1.0 / M_W
cs3 = ChemicalSystem([dict[s] for s in split("H2O@ Na+ Cl-")], ["H2O@", "Na+", "Cl-"])

function gd_residual(mod, m, dn)
    μ = build_potentials(cs3, mod)
    p = (ΔₐG⁰overRT = zeros(3), T = 298.15, P = 1.0e5, ϵ = 1.0e-30)
    n0 = [n_w, m, m]
    δ = 1.0e-6
    dμ = (μ(n0 + δ * dn, p) - μ(n0, p)) / δ
    return abs(sum(n0 .* dμ)) / max(norm(n0 .* abs.(dμ)), 1.0)
end

for (name, dn) in ("dissolution   dn = (0, +1, +1)" => [0.0, 1.0, 1.0],
                   "ion exchange  dn = (0, +1, -1)" => [0.0, 1.0, -1.0],
                   "water removal dn = (-1, 0, 0)" => [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0])
    println("\n── ", name)
    println("   m         dilute       Davies        B-dot")
    for m in (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0)
        r = [gd_residual(mod, m, dn) for (_, mod) in models]
        @printf("%6.2f    %10.3e   %10.3e   %10.3e\n", m, r...)
    end
end
```

Three readings, and they are why this page exists.

**Along a true dissolution**, the B-dot model is four orders of magnitude more
consistent than Davies. And Davies is **worse than assuming ideality** — not a
paradox but the direct consequence of its construction: correcting the solutes
while leaving the solvent at ``a_w = x_w`` makes the two halves of one model
contradict each other, whereas the ideal model at least contradicts itself less.
A model can be *more* wrong for being *partly* corrected.

**Along an ion exchange** at constant ``I`` and constant ``\sum m``, Davies and
the ideal model are indistinguishable — their coefficients depend on ``I``
alone, which does not move — and the only residual left is the B-dot model's own
approximation, the single charge-weighted mean radius in its osmotic
coefficient, showing up at a few parts in a thousand. This is the direction
`test/activities.jl` uses, which is why its tolerance is `5e-3` and not solver
tolerance.

**Along water removal** — the direction a drying paste takes — the ordering is
the same as for dissolution, and the gap widens as the solution concentrates.

So the water-activity route is not a refinement on a number that hardly moves.
It decides whether the model is one thermodynamic system or two halves that
disagree, and only the derivatives show it.

```@example am
p3 = plot(; xscale = :log10, yscale = :log10, xlabel = "molality m (mol/kg)",
    ylabel = "Gibbs-Duhem residual", legend = :topleft,
    title = "…and the derivatives separate by four orders")
mm = [0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0]
for ((name, mod), col) in zip(models, (:gray, :firebrick, :steelblue))
    μ = build_potentials(cs3, mod)
    r = [max(gd_residual(mod, m, [0.0, 1.0, 1.0]), 1.0e-16) for m in mm]
    plot!(p3, mm, r; label = name, linewidth = 2, color = col, marker = :circle)
end
plot(p3; size = (720, 430), left_margin = 10Plots.mm, bottom_margin = 8Plots.mm)
```

Along a dissolution, on a logarithmic axis: Davies sits above the ideal model at
every molality, and the B-dot model below both by three to four orders.

## What to take from this

  - below ``I \approx 0.01`` mol/kg the choice hardly matters, and
    [`DiluteSolutionModel`](@ref) is the best-conditioned objective;
  - between there and about a molal, use [`HKFActivityModel`](@ref) — and use it
    rather than [`DaviesActivityModel`](@ref) whenever the water activity enters
    the question, which in a hydrating paste it always does;
  - above a few molal, none of the three is defensible, and no warning is issued
    because none of them knows. [`solvent_fraction`](@ref) is the guard that
    does.

See also: [Activity models](@ref sec-theory-activity) for where the expressions
come from, and [Solid solution models](@ref sec-app-solid-solutions) for the
same exercise on the mole-fraction side.
