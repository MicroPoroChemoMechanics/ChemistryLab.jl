## Ion-interaction (Pitzer) model

The virial expansion of the excess Gibbs energy: a coefficient per ion pair and
per triplet, so `γ` and the osmotic coefficient come from one function and the
Gibbs-Duhem relation holds by construction. See
[Activity models](@ref sec-theory-activity) §6 for the derivation and
[The Pitzer model](@ref sec-app-pitzer) for what the shipped parameter set can
be used with. Nothing here carries a default: the parameters are caller input.

```

## Aqueous properties

Molalities, ionic strength, activity coefficients and the activity-convention
pH, read back off a solved state. See
[Reading the aqueous properties back](@ref sec-aqueous-properties) for the two
traps these exist to avoid.

## Solid solutions

## Certified equilibrium

Newton on the KKT system in element-potential space, and the certificate that
proves a composition optimal. See
[Proving that an answer is the answer](@ref sec-theory-certificate) for the derivation, and
[`equilibrate_certified`](@ref) for the route `equilibrate` takes by default.

## Constraints

What is held fixed while the Gibbs energy is minimized. See
[Constraints other than fixed T and P](@ref sec-equilibrium-constraints).

## Water retention

The relation between how much water a pore space still holds and how tightly it
holds it — the constitutive input [`CapillaryWater`](@ref) needs, and the source
of the humidity [`PoreHumidity`](@ref) hands to a rate law. It is measured, not
assumed, so nothing here carries a default value.
