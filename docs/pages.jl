# The page tree, grouped by what a chapter is *about* rather than by the order the
# pages were written in.
#
# Four chapters carry the documentation, and the difference between them is the
# question each answers.
#
#   **Theory**    — why is this the right calculation? Readable without running
#                   anything; every equation is the one the code evaluates.
#   **Manual**    — how is this written? One page per kind of object, syntax
#                   first, on the smallest example that shows it.
#   **Tutorials** — how do I drive a calculation from end to end? Narrative, and
#                   each one goes somewhere.
#   **Applications** — what does a real case look like, and what do the choices
#                   cost in numbers? Everything executed lives here.
#   **API**       — the docstrings, generated.
#
# A page that answers two of those questions is worth splitting; a page in the
# wrong chapter is worth moving. `Manual` exists because nine of the fourteen
# pages once filed under `Tutorials` were object syntax rather than a
# calculation, which is what made the chapter hard to navigate.
#
# **Cementitious media is a subsection of four chapters, not a chapter of its
# own.** The material is the subject of the package, so it appears wherever its
# question is being asked: the theory of its water budget, the syntax of its
# species, the trajectory of its hydration, the worked cases. Grouping it into
# one chapter would have separated each of those from the general treatment it
# specializes.
#
# Three paths are load-bearing and must not move: `tutorials/self_desiccation.md`,
# `tutorials/equilibrium.md` and `examples/hydration_calibration.md` are linked by
# URL from released CHANGELOG sections, which are not retro-edited.
